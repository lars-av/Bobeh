        <p>You will be involved in the preparation and ongoing evaluation of your development plan.
          The development plan contains concrete and agreed sub-goals, which are important to you in order to be able to achieve the goals agreed in the overall and guiding action plan that you have made in collaboration with your municipal advisor.

        <h3>Report</h3>
          <p>
          <strong> At least once a year, a written status report will be made.</strong>
          Based on the ongoing evaluations and conversation with you. You will have the opportunity to review this and add your comments before sending it to your municipal advisor.</p>

        <h3>Follow-up meeting</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Often a follow-up meeting will be held with your municipal adviser.</strong>
            In connection with the status report. At the follow-up meeting, we have a joint discussion of how you thrive and develop, and which areas you still need support for. As a starting point for this, we are talking about the further course with an agreement on continued stay or removal to one's own home or other housing offer.</p>

        <h3>Decision making</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>You will also be involved in everyday decisions</strong>,
            e.g. about what social and cultural activities are to be offered or what guidelines are to apply for stays in the common areas, in the house rules of the house.</p>
