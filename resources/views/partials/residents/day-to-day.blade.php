      <p>Bo- og Behandlingscenter Blokhus is like a large family where everyone participates and share responsibilities. Everyday we cook, wash clothes, clean and other daily routines that needs to be completed.
        We put a strong emphasis on providing a safe frame with a predictable structure and present personnel. As we have a lot of different residents, we want everyone to feel they belong.
