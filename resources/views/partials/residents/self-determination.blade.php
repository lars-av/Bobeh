        <p class="">There can be many reasons why, for a period of your life, you need to live in our housing offer.
          But in general, the goal for citizens who are visited for this is that they need help to learn how to cope with their everyday lives and tackle their mental and / or social challenges in a good way. This is with the goal that they may be able to live in an independent home possibly with social pedagogical support.</p>

        <p class="">With us, it is important that each resident is involved in their own development process. This is because we believe that involvement in itself is a strong motivating tool.
          This also leans on our values ​​at Bo- og Behandlingscenter Blokhus .</p>

        <h3 class="margin-2-y">Right to self-determination</h3>
        <p class="">When you live in a housing offer, you still decide over your own life, and the room you are allocated is your home. This means that we are not allowed to enter your room unless you have given us permission to do so. Nor can we force you to accept our help and guidance if you do not feel like it.

          In legislation, this is called the right of self-determination.</p>
