<p style ="max-width: 65%; line-height: 1.7rem;"> At Bo- og Behandlingscenter Blokhus, our goal is to be really able to help and support our residents in their everyday lives, so that the individual resident's experience of coping and quality of life is increased. Through our pedagogical practice , it is our ambition to meet the individual at eye level, where they are,  so that we can create a good daily structure and adapt requirements to the individual's prerequisites.</p>

    <p>Our staff group is composed interdisciplinary of educators, occupational therapists, teachers and health professionals who work from a common interdisciplinary starting point. We use the KRAP method as a basic framework for our pedagogical work and documentation.</p>

    <p>The method works both as a pedagogical toolbox and more generally as a human vision, where we believe that everyone does the best they can based on their premise. We generally want the culture of our departments to be characterized by being appreciative and resource focused.
